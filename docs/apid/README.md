# Introduction to Gravitee API Designer (APID)

Gravitee API Designer (APID), a Gravitee Cloud offering, employs a no-code graphical interface and [Design First](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/why-design-first-when-building-apis) approach to quickly create APIs that are fully [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)-compliant. A completed design can exported as an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or pushed to a linked Gravitee API Management installation.

Gravitee API Designer accelerates business by:

* Shifting the focus of API development from technical aspects to customer needs
* Empowering users to own API design and customization
* Embracing a quick feedback loop to improve the quality of APIs
