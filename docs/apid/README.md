# Introduction to Gravitee API Designer (APID)

The Gravitee API Designer (APID), part of the Gravitee Cloud, is a graphical no-code tool for creating APIs. This [Design First](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/why-design-first-when-building-apis) approach can produce fully [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)-compliant APIs in minutes.

When youâ€™re happy with your design, you can export it as an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or push it to one of your linked **Gravitee.io API Management** installations.

From a business perspective, the **Gravitee.io API Designer**:

* Allows you to focus on the future needs of your customers rather than on the technical aspects
* Empowers business users to design the APIs they own
* Embraces the quick feedback loop to improve the quality of your APIs
