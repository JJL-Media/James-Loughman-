# Introduction to Gravitee API Designer (APID)

Gravitee API Designer (APID), a Gravitee Cloud offering, is a no-code tool that uses a [Design First](https://www.gravitee.io/blog/why-design-first-when-building-apis) approach to quickly create a fully [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/)-compliant API.

Your completed design can exported as an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) or pushed to a linked Gravitee API Management installation.

From a business perspective, the **Gravitee.io API Designer**:

* Allows you to focus on the future needs of your customers rather than on the technical aspects
* Empowers business users to design the APIs they own
* Embraces the quick feedback loop to improve the quality of your APIs
