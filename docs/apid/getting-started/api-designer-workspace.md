# API Designer Workspace

Navigating to the API Designer in Gravitee Cloud opens the API Designer Workspace, the administrative interface to the API Designer. Use the workspace to manage existing API designs, create new designs, and configure settings.

{% hint style="info" %}
The workspace is organization-centric. API designs and settings exist within the context of the selected organization.
{% endhint %}

## Workspace Actions

The workspace menu divides administrative tasks into two sections: API Designs and Settings:

**API Designs**

* Create an API
* Manage an API

**Settings**

* Case: Indicate how case should be applied to paths, objects, and parameters.
* Target Environment: Select the environment to which the API design will be deployed.
* Legend: Define the visual cues to distinguish between design attributes.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only environments linked to active API Management installations will be shown.
