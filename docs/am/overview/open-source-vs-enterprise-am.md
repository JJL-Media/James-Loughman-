While not technically a part of the Access Management product, Gravitee does offer a standalone API Monitoring solution called Gravitee Alert Engine. Gravitee Alert Engine (AE) is Gravitee's enterprise grade API Monitoring solution. Alert Engine (AE) provides APIM and AM users with efficient and flexible API platform monitoring, including advanced alerting configuration and notifications sent through their preferred channels, such as email, Slack and Webhooks.Alert Engine integrates with Gravitee API Management to enable advanced alerting, new dashboards, and more. For more information, please refer to [the Alert Engine documentation](https://documentation.gravitee.io/ae/overview/introduction-to-gravitee-alert-engine).

### Advanced environment management <a href="#advanced-environment-management" id="advanced-environment-management"></a>

Gravitee EE AM enables you to register multiple AM environments and installations using [Gravitee Cloud.](https://documentation.gravitee.io/gravitee-cloud) This enables you to manage environment hierarchies and promote APIs across higher and lower environments.

### Hosting options <a href="#hosting-options" id="hosting-options"></a>

An investment in Gravitee EE is an investment in deployment flexibility, and, optionally, the ability to offload costs associated with maintaining self-hosted AM installations. Gravitee Enterprise supports:

* **Self-hosted deployments**: install and host AM within your own private cloud/environment
* **Gravitee-managed deployments**: Gravitee hosts and manages all AM components within its own cloud environments
* **Hybrid deployment**: Gravitee hosts and manages some AM components in its own cloud environment while you manage some components in your own private cloud/environment

For more information on each, please refer to our [AM Architecture documentation](am-architecture.md).

#### Support options <a href="#support-options" id="support-options"></a>

Gravitee offers enterprise-grade support for enterprise customers. Gravitee offers three different support packages: Gold, Platinum, and Diamond. Each has different SLAs, benefits, etc. For more information on each support option, please [refer to our pricing page](https://www.gravitee.io/pricing).
