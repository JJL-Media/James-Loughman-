# Timeout management

## Overview

With the legacy execution engine, when a timeout is configured (`http.requestTimeout`) and triggered due to a request that is too slow (or a policy taking too much time to execute), the API platform flows are always skipped and a `504` status is sent as a response to the client.

## Reactive execution engine improvements

A timeout can now be triggered at two places in the chain:

* The flow can be interrupted between the beginning of a Gateway API's request phase and the end of the response phase. In this case, a platform response flow will still be executed.
* The flow can be interrupted during the platform response flow when the overall request time is too long. This results in a `504` response and the platform response flow is interrupted.

Two properties are available to configure these triggers:

* `http.requestTimeout`: The duration used to configure the timeout of the request
* `http.requestTimeoutGraceDelay`: Additional time used to give the platform response flow a chance to execute

The timeout value is calculated from the following two properties:

* `Timeout = Max(http.requestTimeoutGraceDelay, http.requestTimeout - apiElapsedTime)`
* With `apiElapsedTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - request().timestamp()`

**Timeout configuration**

With the reactive execution engine, timeout values of `0` and less are treated as meaning 'no timeout' (like the legacy engine). If you configure the timeout with a positive value, then it will act normally.

If no configuration is provided, a default configuration is set to default to 30000 ms timeout.

## **Examples**

In the following examples, we assume that there is no timeout defined for the backend in the APIâ€™s endpoint configuration. In real life, those timeout values should be shorter than `http.requestTimeout`, and should interrupt the flow at the invoker level.

We will use `http.requestTimeout=2000ms` and `http.requestTimeoutGraceDelay=30ms`.

The example below shows timelines indicating when a timeout should occur depending on the duration of the API flow and the response platform flows:
