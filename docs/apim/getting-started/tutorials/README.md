# Tutorial: Demo Application

These tutorials do not assume any existing Gravitee API Management (APIM) knowledge and are designed for people who prefer to learn by doing. The techniques youâ€™ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to working with APIM. You will be working with a demo application that simulates how APIM might be used in a real-world use case. If you'd prefer to learn APIM's core concepts step by step, head over to our [Guides section](../../guides/prologue.md) to explore our detailed walkthroughs.

## Demo Application Overview



## Prerequisites

These tutorials are designed to work seamlessly with our enterprise trial as they demonstrate a number of enterprise-only features. To get started with the free enterprise trial, simply follow the [instructions laid out here](../install-and-upgrade/free-trial.md). Setting up a new trial takes approximately five minutes and you can return here to select any of the following paths to experience the power of Gravitee API Management alongside our demo application:
