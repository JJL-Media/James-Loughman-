# Tutorial: Trial Application

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Coming soon!** The updated 4.0 trial and trial application are not yet available.
{% endhint %}

These tutorials do not assume any existing Gravitee API Management (APIM) knowledge and are designed for people who prefer to learn by doing. The techniques youâ€™ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to working with APIM. You will be using a trial application that simulates how APIM might be used in a real-world use case. If you'd prefer to learn APIM's core concepts step by step, head over to our [Guides section](../../guides/prologue.md) to explore our detailed walkthroughs.

## Prerequisites

These tutorials are designed to work seamlessly with our enterprise trial as they demonstrate a number of [enterprise-only features](../../overview/introduction-to-gravitee-api-management-apim/ee-vs-oss.md). To get started with the free enterprise trial, simply follow the [instructions laid out here](../install-and-upgrade/free-trial.md). Setting up a new trial takes approximately five minutes. Then you can return here to experience the power of Gravitee API Management alongside our demo application.&#x20;

The introductory use case: Basic Security and Access Control, should be completed first as the advanced use cases are dependent on it. The advanced use cases can then be completed in any order:
