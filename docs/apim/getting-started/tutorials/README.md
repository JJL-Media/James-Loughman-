# Tutorials: Trial Application

## Overview

These tutorials are designed as a hands-on introduction to Gravitee API Management (APIM) and employ techniques that are fundamental to working with APIM. To demonstrate how APIM applies to real-world use cases, you will be completing these tutorials with a preconfigured trial application. For more detailed exposure to each of APIM's core concepts and features, visit our [Guides section](../../guides/prologue.md).

Share your trial experience and suggest ideas for future tutorials on the Gravitee [community forum](https://community.gravitee.io/).

## Prerequisites

These tutorials demonstrate some [enterprise-only features](../../overview/ee-vs-oss/) and are designed to work seamlessly with Gravitee's enterprise trial.&#x20;

To begin, [sign up for an enterprise trial of Gravitee API Management](../install-and-upgrade/free-trial.md). Your first environment will be set up in just a few minutes and is preconfigured with APIs to help demonstrate the value of both traditional and event-native API Management.

Once you're set-up, you can return here to experience the power of Gravitee API Management alongside our trial application.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are relatively new to web APIs and/or Gravitee's approach to API management, we recommend first taking a look at the [Gravitee Essentials guide](https://documentation.gravitee.io/platform-overview/gravitee-essentials/overview).

## Getting started

We recommend first completing the beginner use case, Gateway APIs and Policies, for an easy and quick introduction to the Gravitee APIM fundamentals. The intermediate and advanced use cases can then be completed in any order:
