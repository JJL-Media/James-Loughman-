# Expression language

### Introduction

The Gravitee API Management (APIM) Expression Language (EL) is a powerful language used for querying and manipulating an object graph and can be used by API publishers to configure various aspects and services of an API. It is based on the [SpEL (Spring Expression Language)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#expressions). In addition to the core features that the SpEL delivers, APIM extends the standard SpEL capabilities by providing extra objects and properties inside the expression language context.
