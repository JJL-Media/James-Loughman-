# Endpoint implementation

## Overview

Gravitee supports several different message brokers. This page describes the integrations Gravitee uses to enable Kafka, MQTT, RabbitMQ, and Solace endpoints for v4 API definitions. These rely of the following terminology and functionality:

* **Request-Id**: A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) generated for any new request. This can be overridden using `X-Gravitee-Request-Id`as a Header or Query parameter.
* **Transaction-Id**: A UUID generated for any new request. This can be overridden using `X-Gravitee-Transaction-Id`as a Header or Query parameter.
* **Client-Identifier**: Inferred from the subscription attached to the request. It is either the subscription ID, or, with a Keyless plan, a hash of the remote address. The **Client-Identifier** can be provided by the client via the header `X-Gravitee-Client-Identifier`. In this case, the value used by Gravitee will be the original inferred value suffixed with the provided overridden value.
