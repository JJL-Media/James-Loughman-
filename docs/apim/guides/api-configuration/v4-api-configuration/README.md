## Introduction

Gravitee offers several levels of configuration for v4 APIs using the Gravitee APIM Console. In this section, we'll cover:

* Portal configuration
  * **General settings**: define the general settings for your API, such as name, description, and deployment status
  * **Plans configuration**: define plans and basic access control mechanisms
* Entrypoints&#x20;
  * **General entrypoint configuration**: configure how consumers access the gateway through your gateway API
* Endpoints
  * **Backend service configuration**: configure the backend target or resource that your gateway API will call/subscribe to
