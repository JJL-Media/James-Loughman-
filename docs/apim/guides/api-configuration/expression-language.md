# Expression language

### Introduction

The Gravitee API Management (APIM) Expression Language (EL) is a powerful language used for querying and manipulating an object graph and can be used by API publishers to configure various aspects and services of an API. It is based on the [SpEL (Spring Expression Language)](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html#expressions). In addition to the core features that the SpEL delivers, APIM extends the standard SpEL capabilities by providing extra objects and properties inside the expression language context.

### Using the APIM EL

Before you start using the EL, you need to know that the basic EL syntax is as follows:

{#request.id}

### Examples of the Gravitee EL in use

The following sections illustrate examples of using the EL for:

* API properties
* API request properties
