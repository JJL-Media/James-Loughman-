# Developer Portal

Gravitee API Management (APIM) allows you to expose APIs to both internal and external consumers using the Developer Portal. The _Developer Portal_ is a web application that acts as a centralized catalog for internal/external API consumers to discover, find, and subscribe to APIs that are developed, managed, and deployed by API publishers.&#x20;

Most of the features seen in the Developer Portal are also available in the Management Console as detailed in the [API Exposure guide](../api-exposure-plans-applications-and-subscriptions/). However, the Developer Portal provides a simplified, user-friendly interface that is tailored to the API consumption process. API consumers can easily discover and explore APIs, read documentation, test API endpoints, generate API keys, view API analytics, and manage their API subscriptions in a central location. Additionally, administrators have significantly more control over the look and feel of the Developer Portal when compared to the Management Console allowing them to deliver an accessible and on-brand experience to external API consumers.&#x20;

This documentation is intended to provide a detailed overview of the Developer Portal's features and functionality, as well as step-by-step instructions on how to use them. Whether you're an administrator looking to set up custom branding and access control to the Developer Portal, an API consumer looking to subscribe to APIs, or an API publisher looking to manage your exposed APIs, this documentation will help you get the most out of the Developer Portal.
