# Developer Portal

Gravitee API Management (APIM) allows you to expose APIs to both internal and external consumers using the developer portal. The _developer portal_ is a centralized catalog where internal/external API consumers can discover, find, and subscribe to APIs that are developed, managed, and deployed by API publishers.&#x20;
