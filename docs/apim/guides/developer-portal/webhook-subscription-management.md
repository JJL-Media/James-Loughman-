# Webhook Subscription Management

This article covers how API consumers can configure their Webhook subscriptions from the Developer Portal. It covers:

* Adding a callback URL
* Choosing an application
* Validating the request

## Find the Webhook subscription in the Developer Portal

Before you can define and configure your Webhook subscription, you'll need to find the Webhook subscription in the Developer Portal.

Now, it's time to subscribe. Select **Subscribe,** and you'll need to choose a **Push plan.** A Push plan is limited to Webhooks and enables you to subscribe to APIs that have a subscription listener, which, as of now, is limited to Webhooks.&#x20;

Select your Subscription channel and your Webhook entrypoint, and then you will be able to define:

* Callback URL
* HTTP headers: the list of headers to add to the request by the callback URL
* Security config
  * Security type: either basic, token, or OAuth2
  * SSL options:
    * Enable or disable **Verify Host**
    * Enable or disable **Trust all**
    * Define your **Trust store**
    * Define your **Key store**

Next, you'll need to choose which application you want to be the subscriber. Optionally, you can leave a message for the API Owner.
