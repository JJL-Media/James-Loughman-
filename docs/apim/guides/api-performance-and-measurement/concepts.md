# Concepts

## Measurement, tracking, analytics, auditing, and logging

Gravitee offers several ways to measure, track and analyze APIs, in addition to capturing logs so that you can easily stay on top of your APIs and retain visibility into performance and consumption. Let's explore the various platform components and features that enable thisâ€”at a conceptual level.

### The Dashboard

The Gravitee "Dashboard" is an area in the UI where you'll be able to create custom dashboards around API performance, status, lifecycle stage, and more. The dashboard includes several sub-modules across different tabs, each with various features. To explore in depth, feel free to use the interactive UI exploration tool or the text descriptions provided below.
