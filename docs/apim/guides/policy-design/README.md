# Policy Design Studio

The Gravitee Policy Design Studio allows you to design "flows," or policy enforcement sequences that protect, transform, or otherwise alter how APIs are consumed. Gravitee comes with many different baked in policies, some that come with the community version and some that are only available in Gravitee Enterprise. For more information on specific policies, please refer to the [Policy Reference documentation](policy-reference.md).&#x20;
