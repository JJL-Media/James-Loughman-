# v2 API Policy Design Studio

## Introduction

The Gravitee Policy Design Studio allows you to design "flows," or policy enforcement sequences that protect, transform, or otherwise alter how APIs are consumed. Gravitee comes with many differnet baked in policies, some that come with the community version and some that are only availble in Gravitee Enterprise. For more information on specific policies, please refer to the [Policy Reference documentation](policy-reference.md).&#x20;

The rest of this article provides a walk through of the v2 API Policy Design studio.&#x20;

Legacy version

The v2 Policy Design Studio can only be used to design flows for APIs using the v2 API definition. The v2 Policy Design studio does not support applying policies at the message level or for pub/sub use cases. If you want to design and enforce policy flows at the message level or for pub/sub use cases, please refer to the [v4 Policy Design studio documentation.](v4-api-policy-design-studio.md)
