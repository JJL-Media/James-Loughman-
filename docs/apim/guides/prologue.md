The "Guides" section is here to dive into everything you need to know in order to use the Gravitee platform and specific features. As of now, our guides focus on the following categories of usage:

* Designing policies
* Configuring plans, subscriptions, and applications
* Ensuring API performance and measuring API consumption
* How to push APIs to and use the Gravitee Developer Portal for API Discovery
* How to administer your Gravitee platform and users
* How to contribute to the Gravitee platform as a Developer

The "Concepts" section will include content that explains the UI components, features, etc. per usage category at a conceptual level (i.e. "The API creation wizard's 'Entrypoint' item is..."). The "How-to" section will cover how to actually use the specific features (i.e. "To choose how API consumers will consume data from your target or source, select your "Entrypoint" by...).&#x20;
