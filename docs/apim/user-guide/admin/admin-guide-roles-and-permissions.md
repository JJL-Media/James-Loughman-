# admin-guide-roles-and-permissions

## Overview

APIM allows you to create custom user roles to fit your needs. Some default roles are provided for you.

In APIM, a role:

* is associated with a group of permissions
* has a scope
* defines what you can do with the APIM UI components and APIM API

Before defining some key concepts, we recommend you first take a look at the new link:\{{ _/apim/3.x/apim\_adminguide\_organizations\_and\_environments.html_ | relative\_url \}}\[Gravitee.io Platform design^].

Any changes to a role may take a short time to be applied to a user.

### Scopes

Roles are defined in terms of _scopes_. As described in the link:\{{ _/apim/3.x/apim\_adminguide\_organizations\_and\_environments.html_ | relative\_url \}}\[Organizations and environments] page, an _environment_ corresponds roughly to what you can find in APIM Portal. More precisely, an environmentâ€™s scope is all of the actions that can be performed in the specific context, whether in APIM Portal or APIM Console.

For example:

* APIs can be managed by API publishers in APIM Console.
* Applications can be managed in both APIM Console and APIM Portal.
* API ratings can be managed by API consumers in APIM Portal.

As the name suggests, the scope of an _organization_ is all aspects of an organization: users, roles, and so on. Organization-level actions are only available in APIM Console.

A user can have more than one organization role and more than one environment role.

The scopes of _API_ and _application_ work slightly differently.

As an API publisher or consumer, you have access to APIs and/or applications. APIM allows you to have a different role for each API and application. You can be the owner for one, an ordinary user for another and the person in charge of writing the documentation for another. This means that the API and application roles are only meaningful in terms of their association with an API or application.

### Role

A role is a functional group of permissions. There is no limit to the number of roles you can create. They all need to be administered, however.

Some roles are special. The are tagged as `System` or `Default`.

#### System role

The Organization Admin role is a read-only role (i.e. you cannot change its permissions) used by APIM.

This role gives the user all permissions. If any accidental loss of access happened to another role, a user with this role will still be able to perform the action or restore required privileges.

Historically, the roles listed bellow were also created as read-only system roles and are still tagged as such, but they have been made editable for the sake of administration flexibility.

1. The Environment Admin role
2. The API Primary Owner role
3. The Application Primary Owner role

In order to edit this roles, you need to activate this mode in `gravitee.yml`

```
console:
  systemRoleEdition:
    enabled: true
```

Updating permissions for system roles should be done carefully to avoid any unexpected behavior.

#### Default role

The Default role is the role used by APIM when a role is not specified. For example, new registered users are assigned the default `ENVIRONMENT` and `ORGANIZATION`. The Default role gives the user limited permissions.

You can change the default on each scope.

### Permission

A permission is a list of actions allowed on a resource. The actions are `Create`, `Read`, `Update` and `Delete`.

The list of permissions by scope is as follows:

| Name                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

`APPLICATION` scope permissions

## Create a custom role

In this example, we will create a writer role which allows a user to create API documentation.

### Create the `WRITER` role

1. link:\{{ _/apim/3.x/apim\_quickstart\_console\_login.html_ | relative\_url \}}\[Log in to APIM Console].
2.  In the **Organization Settings > Roles** page, click **ADD A NEW ROLE**.

    image::\{% link images/apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-create.png %\}\[Gravitee.io - Create a New Role]

### Configure the `WRITER` role

Assign the following permissions to the writer role:

* `READ` permissions on `DEFINITION` and `GATEWAY_DEFINITION`â€‰â€”â€‰this allows the user to see the API in the API list
* `CRUD` permissions on `DOCUMENTATION`

image::\{% link images/apim/3.x/adminguide/newrole-configure.png %\}\[Gravitee.io - Configure a New Role]

### Result

Users with this role can now only see the documentation menu.

Granting `GROUP` permissions to the `MANAGEMENT` role also requires the `READ` operation for the `ROLE` permission in order to see which roles are provided by a group.
