# Content

* The Gravitee Glossary is the source of truth for the definitions and capitalization of product or generalized terminology.
* With the exception of the API Fundamentals section, do not link to non-Gravitee references.&#x20;
  * Gravitee documentation is the source of truth for all information in the docs site. Do not cite other organizations for definitions or explanations. Instead, establish Gravitee as an authority via self-referencing or original text.&#x20;
* Avoid mentioning version numbers in text body.&#x20;
  * Mentions of applicable versions are limited to compatibility matrices, headers, and other top-level identifiers that are easily found, modified, and maintained
* Do not promise features or functionality in future releases. This undersells the current product and is irrelevant.&#x20;
  * Future work is reserved for marketing/CS material and does not belong in docs, which is a technical reference for the existing products available to customers.
