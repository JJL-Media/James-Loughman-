# Lists

* Colons should be used in bulleted lists to separate the term being defined from the definition.
* The first word of the definition following a colon should be capitalized unless it is:
  * A formatted element, e.g., `filename.txt`
  * Lowercase by definition, e.g., v2 API definition
* List items comprising bullets or steps (i.e., descriptions or instructions) can either be complete sentences or sentence fragments.&#x20;
* Terminating list items (either complete sentences or sentence fragments) with a period is optional, but the decision to use punctuation must apply to each item within a given list.&#x20;
  * The exception to this rule is when a given list consists of both multi-sentence and single-sentence/sentence-fragment items. In this case, all multi-sentence list items must punctuate with periods, but punctuation for single-sentence/sentence-fragment items is optional.
* List items that are terms or things, e.g., product features, are never punctuated.
* It is not necessary for list items to be in complete sentence form, as this promotes redundancy and bloat.&#x20;
  * Fragments should be used whenever possible, especially following colons.
  * Fragments should be complete, i.e., include all prepositions and articles required to constitute partial sentences.&#x20;
  * If a bullet requires more than a single complete sentence or sentence fragment, this should be in the form of a complete sentence.
* Do not use numbered bullets unless the bulleted information is sequential.
* Limit numbered bullets to the minimum required to fully resolve a single task or concept.
