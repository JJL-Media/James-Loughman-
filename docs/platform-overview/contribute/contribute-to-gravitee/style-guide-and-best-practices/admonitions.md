# Admonitions

* Admonitions should be concise and supplemental.
* Header use is largely discretionary, but required if the content is tangential instead of a corollary, i.e., if the content is only indirectly related to the discussion.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**

An informational hint provides context or clarification that, while informative, is not critical to understanding the material or completing a task.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Caution**

A cautionary icon identifies common issues or misconceptions related to the current material and intended to prevent confusion or mistakes.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning**

A warning label draws attention to potential vulnerabilities or limitations, e.g., known security, reliability, or dependency issues. Include links to further explanation or resources for risk mitigation.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Success**

A green check is a mechanism for user alignment. The message provides success criteria for task completion.
{% endhint %}
