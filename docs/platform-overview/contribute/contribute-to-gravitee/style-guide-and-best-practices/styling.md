# Styling

## General

* UI element wording and capitalization should be preserved to ensure an exact match between what appears in product and documentation.
* Avoid italicized font. It can be difficult to read and/or differentiate from regular font and does not clearly indicate significance.
* Use bold font:
  * To signify UI elements, e.g., nav entries, pages, tabs, features, properties, attributes, etc., This is critical when the name of a single element/feature in product comprises multiple words and/or each word in the name is not capitalized.&#x20;
  * For terms defined in bulleted format.
* Hyphens should only be used to link object modifiers into a composite adjective, e.g., real-time, event-driven, etc.
* Do not use quotes for emphasis. Quotes are reserved for example user input that must be differentiated from the text body it appears within.
* To quote a source, use quotation marks in conjunction with block quotes provided by the Gitbook text editor, then cite the speaker or entity in the following line.

## Headers

* When using the Gitbook editor, select H1 for the title of each top-level section within a page.&#x20;
  * When the markdown is converted to HTML, the page title translates to H1 and H1 title selections translate to H2.
* Headers are reserved for semantic structuring and correspond to hierarchical section tiers: H1 designates a top-level section title, H2 designates a subsection of H1, and H3 designates a subsection of H2.&#x20;
  * As headers dictate how the TOC in the nav is displayed, it is critical that they are never employed for a different purpose, e.g., emphasis or styling.
* With the exception of proper nouns, only the first word of a page title or header is capitalized.
* Do not alter headers, including but not limited to the following:
  * Customize the header color
  * Italicize a header
  * Strikethrough a header
  * Link from a header, i.e., convert the header to a link
  * Annotate a header
* Headers are equipped with anchor link functionality and can be linked to for navigational convenience.
* Use code block format within headers as appropriate, e.g., to signify a file name or programming element.
