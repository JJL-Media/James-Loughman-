# Formatting

## General

* Streamline documentation wherever possible via expandables, tabs, etc., to shorten page length and provide visual cues with respect to page organization.
* Eliminate redundancy by applying a single generalized or parent definition, explanation, instruction set, etc., to multiple derivatives or children via an umbrella structure.

> "Use bold font:

> * To signify UI elements, e.g., nav entries, pages, tabs, features, properties, attributes, etc., This is critical when the name of a single element/feature in product comprises multiple words and/or each word in the name is not capitalized.&#x20;
> * For terms defined in bulleted format."
