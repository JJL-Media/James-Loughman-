# Language

## General

* Eliminate unnecessary language
* Eliminate colloquial language
* Eliminate grammatical/language eccentricities that deviate from a professional, objective, common tone
* Eliminate vague or ambiguous language
* “Click” is used for digitally pressing a UI element, such as a button, to perform an action. Clicking results in a graphical change, e.g., an option is grayed out or a new screen loads, etc.
* “Select” is used to highlight or otherwise choose a UI element, such a drop-down option, where no action is performed. A different selection can be made without returning the UI to a former state.

## Terminology

* Refer to the company or platform as “Gravitee,” not “Gravitee.io.”
* Refer to the Gravitee Glossary for product/feature capitalization rules and apply them consistently.
* All product names should be capitalized and preceded by “Gravitee” when first introduced, e.g., Gravitee API Management.&#x20;
  * Subsequent product mentions must remain capitalized, but the preceding “Gravitee” may be omitted, e.g., API Management.
* To use abbreviations for Gravitee products:&#x20;
  * The first product mention must appear as the full product name and be followed by the abbreviation in parentheses, e.g., Gravitee API Management (APIM).
* Gravitee uses the terms “API” and “web API” interchangeably.&#x20;
  * Gravitee focuses predominantly, if not exclusively, on web APIs which largely eliminates the need to differentiate between web and local APIs.&#x20;
  * If an API is not a web API, Gravitee explicitly refers to it as a “local API.”
