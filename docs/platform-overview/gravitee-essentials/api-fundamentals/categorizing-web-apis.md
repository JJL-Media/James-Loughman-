# Categorizing Web APIs

Web APIs are categorized as synchronous or asynchronous and stateless or stateful. Although they can be differentiated into separate categorizations, these concepts are often subject to cross-pollination. Their respective details and relationships are further explored below in [asynchronous vs asynchronous](categorizing-web-apis.md#synchronous-vs-asynchronous-9) and [stateful vs stateless web APIs](categorizing-web-apis.md#stateful-vs-stateless-web-apis-13).

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous <a href="#synchronous-vs-asynchronous-9" id="synchronous-vs-asynchronous-9"></a>

Synchronous (sync) vs asynchronous (async) web APIs represent a demarcation and paradigm shift in API communication consequent to event streaming complementing the request-response network communication model. The following sections broadly introduce synchronous and asynchronous patterns before applying these concepts to web APIs.

### **Sync vs async programming**

Synchronous programming is the linear, sequential execution of tasks, where the completion of each task blocks the start of the following task. Asynchronous programming is the concurrent execution of tasks, where tasks can be performed partially or totally out of order but rapid task-switching (multitasking) is not equivalent to [parallelism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel\_computing), which is the simultaneous execution of two or more tasks. Concurrency does not imply parallelism, as managing multiple tasks simultaneously is different from performing multiple tasks simultaneously. Although the high-level differentiator is clear-cut, it can be difficult to [disambiguate concurrency and parallelism](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1050222/what-is-the-difference-between-concurrency-and-parallelism) due to functional overlap and contextual terminology.

The following functions demonstrate sync vs async programming at the expense of implementation logic. By design, Javascript inhibits synchronous, blocking code, but it's used for the examples below because it is the [single-threaded language](https://medium.com/swlh/what-does-it-mean-by-javascript-is-single-threaded-language-f4130645d8a9) that powers the web and asynchronous programming is core to much of its functionality.&#x20;

```javascript
const simulateSyncWork = function (work, ms) {
  const end = new Date().getTime() + ms;
  while (new Date().getTime() < end) {
    /* do nothing */
  }
  return console.log(`${work} Complete`);
};

console.time("Sync time");

simulateSyncWork("Web API Work", 3000);

simulateSyncWork("Local Work 1", 1000);
simulateSyncWork("Local Work 2", 2000);
simulateSyncWork("Local Work 3", 1000);

setTimeout(() => console.timeEnd("Sync time"), 1);
```

This simple example sets synchronous function calls that block execution of the main thread for specified durations. the passed string indicates either a web API call or actions executed locally and the script returns a total run time of approximately 7 seconds.

```
// Console Output:

// Web API Work Complete
// Local Work 1 Complete
// Local Work 2 Complete
// Local Work 3 Complete
// Sync time: 7001.510986328125 ms
```

The synchronous call to the web API requires the main thread to wait for a return value from a remote party. The following code modifies the same program to implement an asynchronous call to the same web API.

```javascript
const simulateAsyncWork = function (work, ms) {
  return setTimeout(() => console.log(`${work} Complete`), ms);
};
const simulateSyncWork = function (work, ms) {
  const end = new Date().getTime() + ms;
  while (new Date().getTime() < end) {
    /* do nothing */
  }
  return console.log(`${work} Complete`);
};

console.time("Async time");

simulateAsyncWork("Web API Work", 3000);

simulateSyncWork("Local Work 1", 1000);
simulateSyncWork("Local Work 2", 2000);
simulateSyncWork("Local Work 3", 1000);

setTimeout(() => console.timeEnd("Async time"), 1);
```

Changing the synchronous web API call to an asynchronous API call reduces the total run time to approximately 4 seconds.

```
// Console Output:

// Local Work 1 Complete
// Local Work 2 Complete
// Local Work 3 Complete
// Web API Work Complete
// Async time: 4002.68212890625 ms
```

The asynchronous implementation of the simulated API call allows the main thread to defer execution and continue with subsequent tasks. Once the web API has completed its work, it is added to a task queue for the main thread to return to once the call stack is empty. This is why the asynchronous call to the web API is the last function to return a value, and the overall program completes in approximately 4 seconds instead of 7.

Though contrived, the above example effectively illustrates the power of asynchronous programming. Both `simulateSyncWork("Web API Work", 3000)` and `simulateAsyncWork("Web API Work", 3000)` represent calls to the same web API, but asynchronous programming enabled a change in response as further clarified by the following graphics.

### **Sync vs async web APIs**

The concepts of sync vs async programming and sync vs async APIs are related. Just like asynchronous programming breaks up the linear, sequential execution flow of a program, an asynchronous web API breaks up the linear, sequential communication between information producers and consumers. This is achieved via the event streaming network communication model.&#x20;

Asynchronous API clients do not initiate communication beyond expressing initial interest in a data stream. Instead, communication is triggered by events, which are changes in state. In async communication, a client subscribes to a particular data stream, a change of state occurs, a broker delivers this change of state to all subscribed clients, and each client processes the data for a particular end use. Entire systems built around this flow employ what is broadly termed event-driven architecture (EDA). EDA is an architectural style that exists at the system level instead of the API level.

To demonstrate the benefits of EDA, consider an example use case where an IoT device tracks real-time temperature changes. Assuming an application must be alerted immediately if the temperature falls below 32F/0C degrees, an HTTP API adhering to the request-response model would need to continuously poll the server hosting the temperature data. Alternatively, an event-driven architecture built around asynchronous APIs following the pub/sub architectural style would allow a subscription to the brokerâ€™s temperature topic. For each temperature change, the broker would instantly push data to the topic, allowing subscribers to develop business logic around the data stream and react to threshold crossings. The publisher of the temperature data would not need to be aware of how or when the data is processed.

For use cases that focus on real-time applications, event-driven architecture and asynchronous APIs enable communication that is significantly more efficient. EDA is a novel way to structure an application and can lead to both internal and external integration challenges. The decision to use async communication is context-dependent and a single system often leverages both synchronous and asynchronous APIs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Generally, the HTTP application protocol is conceptualized and discussed as a synchronous protocol. However, there are different versions of HTTP such as HTTP/1.1 (currently the most widely used version), HTTP/2.0, and HTTP/3.0. HTTP/2.0 functionality like multiplexing begins to break down the strict request/response model because multiple requests can be bundled together returned in any order. The [evolution of HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics\_of\_HTTP/Evolution\_of\_HTTP) serves to caution against oversimplifying protocol classifications.
{% endhint %}

### **Sync vs async reactive programming**

To implement EDA at the component or service level, programmers typically employ a technique known as [reactive programming](https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754), where events are the main orchestrators of application flow and program logic is built around asynchronous communication to manipulate operate on data streams.&#x20;

Reactive programming exposes the limitations of traditional message processing, which applies simple computations to individual, or batches of, messages in a message queue. Distributed streaming systems like [Kafka](https://www.confluent.io/what-is-apache-kafka/) store ordered sequences of events, referred to as topics, in a data structure known as a log. Unlike traditional messaging queues, topics allow historical event data to be pulled, unlocking the potential for a slew of input streams to be joined, aggregated, filtered, etc. This is stream processing, which is less about real-time data than complex processing applied across an array of input streams.

### Stateful vs Stateless Web APIs <a href="#stateful-vs-stateless-web-apis-13" id="stateful-vs-stateless-web-apis-13"></a>

The terms "synchronous API" and "stateless API" are often interchangeably, as are "asynchronous API" and "stateful API." While this is often accurate, a label of stateless vs stateful hinges on the perspective of the server or broker.&#x20;

A stateless API means the server does not store any information about the client making the request. In other words, the session is stored on the client, where the session is an encapsulation of a particular client-server interaction. Each client request is self-contained and provides all the information that the server requires to respond, including authentication tokens. The independent nature of each request is core to a stateless API. However, statelessness is not required for synchronous communication, as evidenced by the REST architectural constraint.

Many early web applications were built on stateful, synchronous APIs, as they are generally easier to build and therefore less expensive. With the transition to modern web communication this remains a reasonable approach to small-scale application development. However, problems arise when a single server can no longer handle the load. Every client request must be routed to the server that is currently storing that clientâ€™s session data, or there needs to be a mechanism for sharing session data between multiple servers. This limitation on the horizontal scaling of an applicationâ€™s server-side infrastructure is a major driver of the popularity of REST and REST-like APIs.

When considering asynchronous APIs following the pub/sub pattern, the broker is responsible for pushing data to subscribers and must therefore maintain the session data, which explains why asynchronous APIs are almost always referred to as stateful. However, brokers are not inherently stateful. For example, the messaging platform [Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/2.10.x/concepts-overview/) implements a two-layer architecture consisting of a [stateless layer of brokers](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/2.10.x/concepts-architecture-overview/#brokers) and a stateful persistence layer.
